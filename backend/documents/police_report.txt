NARRATIVE

On March 12, 2021, at approximately 10:45 AM, officers responded to a report of an industrial accident at 2200 West Olympic Boulevard, a commercial renovation site. Upon arrival, Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics were already on scene providing medical assistance to the injured party, Carlos M. Rivera.

Rivera was found on the ground approximately 14 feet below a partially collapsed scaffolding structure on the east side of the building. He was conscious but in visible pain, reporting severe discomfort in his left leg and lower back. Paramedics stabilized Rivera and transported him to California Medical Center via ambulance.

SCENE DESCRIPTION

The scaffolding assembly in question was a frame-type system erected along the eastern facade of the building. A section approximately 12 feet in width had given way. Several cross-braces were found detached on the ground. The base plates on the failed section appeared to be resting on uneven ground, with one plate sitting on a loose plywood sheet rather than a stable footing. Officers observed that portions of the scaffolding in the affected section showed visible rust and wear.

EQUIPMENT AND SAFETY GEAR

Site supervisor Mark Ellison confirmed that Rivera was wearing a hard hat and harness consistent with site requirements at the time of the collapse. The harness lanyard was found still attached to Rivera but had pulled free from the scaffolding anchor point when the structure gave way. Ellison stated that the anchor point was part of the section that collapsed.

WITNESS INFORMATION

Ray Donner, the Harmon Construction Group project foreman, was present on site at the time of the incident. Donner stated that he had directed Rivera and his crew to begin work on the east-side scaffolding section earlier that morning. Donner indicated that the section needed to be operational by end of day to stay on schedule for exterior finishing work. When asked whether he had inspected the scaffolding section before directing the crew to use it, Donner stated, "That's Apex's responsibility. I told them where we needed them working."

A co-worker, Diane Tran, was working on an adjacent scaffolding section approximately 20 feet from Rivera at the time of the collapse. Tran stated that she heard a "loud pop, like metal snapping" followed by the sound of the structure falling. She did not witness the initial failure but turned in time to see Rivera falling with the scaffolding.

Tran further stated that she and other crew members had raised concerns about the condition of the east-side scaffolding earlier in the week, noting that some of the cross-braces "didn't look right" and that the base on the far end "was sitting on a piece of plywood that kept shifting." Tran stated that these concerns were communicated to both Ellison and Donner.

INJURIES

Rivera sustained injuries to his left leg, lower back, and left wrist. He was transported to California Medical Center for evaluation and treatment. The full extent of injuries was pending medical assessment at the time of this report.

ADDITIONAL NOTES

Cal/OSHA was notified of the incident per reporting requirements. A separate Cal/OSHA investigation is expected.

No citations were issued at the scene. This report is for documentation purposes.
