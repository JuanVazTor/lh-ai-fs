I, Diane Tran, provide the following statement of my own free will regarding the incident that occurred on March 12, 2021, at the construction site located at 2200 West Olympic Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.

BACKGROUND

I have worked as a scaffolding technician for Apex Staffing Solutions for approximately three years. I hold a competent person certification for scaffold erection and inspection under Cal/OSHA standards. On the date of the incident, I was assigned to the same project as Carlos Rivera — the commercial renovation at 2200 West Olympic Boulevard, where Harmon Construction Group was the general contractor.

EVENTS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT

On the morning of March 12, 2021, our crew arrived at the site at approximately 7:00 AM. During our morning coordination meeting, Ray Donner — the project foreman for Harmon Construction — told us that the east-side scaffolding section needed to be fully operational by end of day. He said the exterior finishing crew was scheduled to begin work the following Monday and could not be delayed.

Carlos and I were assigned to work on the east-side scaffolding that morning. Before we started, I walked the section to do a visual check. I noticed several things that concerned me:

1. Some of the cross-braces on the lower tier appeared to have significant surface rust and looked like they had been reused from a previous job.
2. The base plate on the far-east end was sitting on a piece of plywood rather than on a proper mudsill or stable footing. The plywood had shifted noticeably since I had last seen it a few days earlier.
3. Two of the coupling pins on the second tier looked bent or worn.

I raised these concerns with our crew lead, Mark Ellison, before we began work. Mark told me he would "take a look," but I did not see him inspect the section. I also mentioned the base plate issue directly to Ray Donner. Donner told me, "We don't have time to re-do the base. It's been fine. Just get up there and get it done."

Carlos was wearing his hard hat, safety harness, and high-visibility vest, consistent with site PPE requirements. I was wearing the same equipment.

THE INCIDENT

At approximately 10:45 AM, I was working on a scaffolding section adjacent to where Carlos was positioned, roughly 20 feet to his west. I heard a loud metallic snap — it sounded like a brace or coupling failing — followed immediately by the sound of the structure collapsing. I turned and saw Carlos falling with the scaffolding. The entire section he was on came down. He landed on the ground approximately 14 feet below.

I climbed down immediately and went to Carlos. He was conscious but clearly in a lot of pain. He was holding his left leg, which was visibly deformed. His harness was still on, but the lanyard had come free — the anchor point it was attached to was part of the scaffolding that collapsed. Several detached cross-braces were on the ground around him.

AFTER THE INCIDENT

Paramedics arrived within about 15 minutes and took Carlos to the hospital. After the area was secured, I overheard Ray Donner speaking with another Harmon supervisor. I heard Donner say something to the effect of, "I told Apex to check their equipment. This is on them."

I want to note that Donner had personally directed us to work on that section that morning and dismissed my concern about the base plate.

In the days following the incident, I observed that the remaining east-side scaffolding was taken down and rebuilt from scratch with new components. The plywood base was replaced with proper concrete footings.

I provide this statement because I believe it is important that the full circumstances of the incident be known. Carlos was doing his job and following safety protocols. The scaffolding he was on was not in safe condition, and concerns about it had been raised before the collapse.
